We had to conduct an aptitude test for close to 200 people at once and with Mettl, it was a piece of cake. nnWe are a small company and all of us play multiple roles and we hardly have any time to do many interviews especially for lateral hiring where you have to screen individually. We wanted to do lateral hiring and wanted to use mettl to save time with the coding test being given to candidates remotely. However, the cost and minimum recharge was not making sense for us as we do lateral hiring once in 3 or 4 months. nnWhen we decided that we would want to do a campus hiring and we would be taking 200 tests all at once, the recharge and the price made sense and it was a quick and easy solution to go for. The tool worked well on the day of hiring except for a few candidates who had network issues and the tests had to be started again from scratch. ",
